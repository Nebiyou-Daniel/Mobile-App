# <u>Workout Warrior</u>

## Description

Workout Warrior is a mobile application that serves as a fitness management (whether it is for weight loss, bodybuilding, or physical fitness) and tracking tool for gym members and personal trainers. Additionally, gym managers can use the app to manage the gym users. The primary function of the app is to provide an easy and efficient way for trainees to access their training plans from their personal trainers.

The app is designed with three user roles: trainee, personal trainer, and gym manager. Trainees are gym members who have been assigned personal trainers and are actively working out at the gym. Personal trainers are certified professionals who are responsible for creating and managing the training plans of their trainees. Gym managers have admin-like privileges and use the app to manage the gym's operations through the app. The app's features include progress tracking, workout scheduling, and communication between trainees and personal trainers.
